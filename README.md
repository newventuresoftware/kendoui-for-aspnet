## Running the Demos

### Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with installed ASP.NET and web development packages.

### MusicStore (ASP.NET MVC Demo)

* All the needed files are already included and referenced, so simply build the project (CTRL + SHIFT + B) to get it ready to run. 
* Use this [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.newventuresoftware.com/blog/getting-started-with-telerik-ui-for-asp.net-mvc) on how to build a Telerik UI ASP.NET MVC project from scratch or how to integrate the Telerik UI MVC suite in an already existing project.

### MovieStore (ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Demo)

* A simple build is sufficient here as well.
* On how to create a new project yourself or integrate the Telerik UI ASP.NET Core suite into an existing project refer to [this article](https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-core/getting-started/getting-started).
