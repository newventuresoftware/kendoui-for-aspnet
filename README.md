## Slides

Open slides/index.html in your browser or run the presentation on [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/newventuresoftware/telerik-ui-for-aspnet/master/slides/index.html).

## Running the Demos

### Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with installed packages for ASP.NET MVC 5 & ASP.NET Core 2.

### MusicStore (ASP.NET MVC Demo)

* All the needed files are already linked and referenced in the project, so a simple rebuild should be enough to get the demo up and running. 
* Use this [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.newventuresoftware.com/blog/getting-started-with-telerik-ui-for-asp.net-mvc) on how to build a Telerik UI ASP.NET MVC project from scratch or how to integrate the Telerik UI MVC suite in an already existing project.

### MovieStore (ASP.NET Core Demo)

* A simple rebuild is sufficient here as well.
* On how to create a new project yourself or integrate the Telerik UI ASP.NET Core suite into an existing project refer to [this article](https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-core/getting-started/getting-started).
